## Oink Guidelines
- If you don't think you will complete an issue, you must inform the rest of the team at least two days in advance.
- Done means that it complies, that you have tested it at least once (and it works :), and compliles with the master branch.
- Every feature is its own branch.
- We will resolve any disputse with a democratic vote.
