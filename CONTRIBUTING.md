## Standup Times
Tuesdays 13:45

Friday 13:00

Mondays and Wednesdays 21:30. 

## Oink Guidelines
- If you don't think you will complete an issue, you must inform the rest of the team at least two days in advance.
- Done means that it loads correctly, that you have tested it at least once (and it works :), and merges with the master branch without conflict.
- Every feature is its own branch.
- We will resolve any dispute with a democratic vote.
- Standup procedure: scrum master takes attendance, documents when and where, poses three questions, everyone else answers in person and on the slack.

## Style guidelines
* 4 spaces for each indent
* camel case for variable names and function names
* curly braces will be 
```javascript
  function myFunction(){
    if (condition){
      /*body*/
    }else{
      /*body*/
    }
  }
```
