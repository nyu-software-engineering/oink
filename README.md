# Oink: A Mobile Piggy Bank

Bill splitters are useful for calculating bills and tips when you go out with friends, but most just calculate the bill without knowing anything about it. Unfortunately, current bill splitters leave many desirable questions unanswered. For example:

- What if you go out with the same group of friends? 
- What if you always split utility bills with your roommates? 
- What if the bills aren't split evenly? What if you have a recurring bill? 

Oink provides the best (and only) solution to these questions.

## Who is it for?

Oink is for anyone who goes out with friends, has roommates, or just needs to split a bill.
This bill splitter will both calculate how you should split a bill, but will also keep track of friends that you usually split with. 

**Have roommates or a weekend brunch crew?** You can create a group to automatically split with everyone in one click.
**Have a roommate that constantly leaves lights or the AC on?** When splitting a bill you can add weights for certain people so that one roommate pays more.

You can set a deadline for a bill payment and add reminders for any recurring bills so that they're paid on time.

If you don't like to split bills but instead prefer to switch who pays each time you go out, you can track how much each person has spent, ensuring
that everyone spends an equal amount.

## A Brief History of Oink

Like anyone else, we've spent far too much time on meals, booking reservations, etc. discussing how exactly to split a bill with friends. It's a common problem, but it really shouldn't be. There's no reason why groups of people should spend several minutes manually calculating percentages and figures when it could all be done for them with the press of a button. With Oink, we wanted to put an end to this problem and create something we could actually see ourselves using on a daily basis!

## Contribution Information

For anyone interested in contributing to the Oink project, simply fork our repo and make any changes you want remotely. Anything you want to add to our current repo you can ask permission for via a pull request, and we'll get back to you shortly on our decision!

For more detailed information, consult our [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/oink/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

A link to the requirements of this project can be found in our [REQUIREMENTS.md](https://github.com/nyu-software-engineering/oink/blob/master/REQUIREMENTS.md) 

## Installation and Building

Once forking and then cloning this repo (or rather, the forked repo) run the command "npm install" in the directory of the oink folder to install all of the project dependencies listed in package.json. NPM must already be instsalled for this command to work.

Additionally, rather than forking the repo, download the zip file of the oink master branch and run the same command on the EXTRACTED folder.

To run the project locally, use the command "npm start" and navigate to "localhost:3000/" to view the Oink home page. Testing the code
can similarly be done with "npm run test-with-coverage" which also indicates the code coverage from the created unit tests.
